A set of reports to obtain relevant information about status, configurations, performance, monitoring on your SQL Server in a quick, concise way.

I want to thank [Carlos Robles](https://twitter.com/dbamastery) ([dbamastery.com](http://dbamastery.com/)) for his support deciding what relevant information to show and to build & tune some of the queries I use.
